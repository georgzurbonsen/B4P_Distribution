// Note the "Shebang" statement on the 1st row:
// It will be recognized by the UNIX/LINUX operating
// system to use Beyond4P to start this script. This
// makes starting scripts as easy as starting
// LINUX sh and bash scripts.

// Attention: Shebangs only work if files are saved with
// LF-only line breaks (Windows style CR+LF won't work)
// common in UNIX / LINUX environments.

// Shebangs are ignored in Microsoft Windows environments.
